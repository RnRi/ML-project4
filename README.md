## COMP 598 - Applied Machine Learning - Final project: Machine Learning for Improving Healthcare

The goal of this project is to investigate healthcare data. In this regard, an interesting prediction problem is chosen and is tackled using machine learning methods. More especifically, predicting the motor and total UPDRS scores for people with early-stage Parkinson's disease (cf: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring) is investigated using appropriate machine learning approaches and methodologies such as SVM and neural network.
